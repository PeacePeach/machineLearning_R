My playground for anything related to Machine Learning in R programming language. Content of this git is based on various books and online tutorials.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Learned

* Supervised Learning:
  1) Linear Regression
  2) Logistic Regression
  3) Decision Trees
  4) Naive Bayes
  5) K-NN
  6) Artificial Neural Network
  7) Support Vector Machine
  8) Deep Learning

* Unsupervised Learning:  
   1) K-Means Clustering  
   2) Hierarchical clustering

## Some Cool R Plots
* CART
